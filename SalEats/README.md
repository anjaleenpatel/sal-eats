# SalEats

SalEats aims to hire drivers to complete food delivery trips
between USC and various restaurants in the proximity.

1) Reads in and parses a JSON file containing various information regarding restaurants and their menus
2) Reads in a text file with information for the orders, like ready time, location order is coming from, and which menu item is being delivered
3) Utilizes multi-threaded programming and semaphore programming to create a simulation of these orders being picked up and delivered given the requirements, assuming the time to travel 1 mile is 1 second
